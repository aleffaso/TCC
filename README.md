<p align="center" ><img style="width:60px;" src="src/unb.png"></p>


## Overview
- The main purpose of this project is to build a monitoring system using IoT for medical application. The application provides knowledge about my studies on `MySQL`, `Electronic Circuits`, `Google Charts`, `arduino` and `MD Boostrap`.

## Idea

- <p align=justify> Internet of Things has increased in some applications. Such as education, social community, security and health care. About health care, thereâ€™s a wide field of study in this area. The main propose of this undergraduate thesis is to show that the way health care is applied can be improved. This change is about applying new data acquisition and processing methods using a controller station and sending information through Internet, this way, decreasing the health service time delay that people face in hospitals.</p>

## Working system

- <p align=justify> The main purpose is based in prototyping a system embedding hardware and software to measure, store and send signals through the internet. To achieve this, an oxygen therapy system has been used to related the breathe oxygen fraction. Through the web, measruments have been obtained using Internet of Things.

## Results

- <p align=justify> The results show that a monitoring system can be turned into IoT integration. This way, sending all information over the web and monitoring health. Moreover, more than one sensor can be used as a way of getting more data.
